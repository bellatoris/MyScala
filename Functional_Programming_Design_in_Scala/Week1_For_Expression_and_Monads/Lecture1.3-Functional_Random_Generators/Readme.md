# Lecture 1.3 - Functional Random Generators

## Other Uses of For-Expressions
* Operations of sets, or databases, or options.
* *Questions:* Are for-expressions tied to collections?
* *Answer:* No! All that is required is some interpretation of `map`, `flatMap` and `withFilter`.
* There are many domains outside collections that afford such an interpretation.
* Example: random value generators.
