# Lecture 6.2 - Combinatorail Search and For-Expressions
## Handling NEsted Sequences 
* We can extend the usage of higher oreder functions on sequences to many calculations which are usually expressed using nested loops.
* **Example:** Given a positive integer `n`, find all pairs of positive integers `i` and `j`, with `1 <= j < i < n` such that `i + j` is prime.
* For example, if `n = 7`, the sought pairs are


| i     | 2 3 4 4 5 6 6  |
|:----- | -------------- |
| j     | 1 2 1 3 2 1 5  |
| i + j | 3 5 5 7 7 7 11 |
